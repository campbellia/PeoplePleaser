Social groups can anonymously decide on choices that benefit everyone in the group.

"What board game should we play tonight?" "Where should we go to eat?" Finding consensus in social groups often falls to a few decisive members of the group, which effaces the preferences of everyone else. Find the happy medium using PeoplePleaser, a decisionmaker designed to weight preferences and find the optimal outcome to satisfy everyone in your group.

To get started, just create a new poll and share the link with anyone. Once the votes are in, generate your results and view how each option is ranked taking everyone's preferences into account.
